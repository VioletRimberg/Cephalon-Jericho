## Usage

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it in the following ways:

1. **Command for role assign and verification**: 
   
    Use `/role` to open a modal to enter a Warframe username. It is then checked in the Warframe API if itâ€™s part of the entered Guild Name and assigns a corresponding role. If a user is not a member, they have the option to choose a guest role. This is also logged in the backend.

2. **Absence report**:
     
     To self-report an absence to prevent kicking or to inform administration/moderators, users can fill out the form pulled up by the `/absence` command. Similar to the Admin tool `/archive`, the input is then sent to the `REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` report text channel.

3. **Other User features**: 
    
    For engagement, Cephalon Jericho offers a simple `/hello` function, as well as a Koumei-inspired dice roller with `/koumei`. For usage of the Warframe API, users can query Warframe profiles with `/profile` as well, which also reports if a user is part of Golden Tenno. Upon popular request, users can interact with Jericho outside of the `/judge_jericho` function with `/smooch` to give their favorite Cephalon a little kiss.

4. **Admin features**:
    
     `/archive` pulls up a modal that allows you to enter a title and report summary, which is then pushed into a corresponding report channel defined with the `REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` in the `.env` file.

5. **Logging**:
    
    To ensure error catching and user issues, most functionalities that require the Warframe API or cause a change in Discord/redirect messages are logged in the backend.
